Package: autoconf
Description-md5: 4ce0439e1f4ccd6c825471aa546f1611
Description-en: automatic configure script builder
 The standard for FSF source packages.  This is only useful if you
 write your own programs or if you extensively modify other people's
 programs.
 .
 For an extensive library of additional Autoconf macros, install the
 `autoconf-archive' package.
 .

 Autoconf 2.13 or earlier.  If you need support for such scripts,
 you must also install the autoconf2.13 package.

Package: automake
Description-md5: c12e147d0e0aa5be7a2c5d8d77613ff5
Description-en: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.14 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 did, so previous versions are
 available as separate packages.

 fine-control settings and features like layers, paths, masks, and
 scripting give you total control over your images.
 .

 and Paint Shop Pro (.psp) files. It can also be used to scan and print
 photos.
 .
 To open files remotely (like over HTTP), install the gvfs-backends

 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.

 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.

 There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild incaration:
 - One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
 - Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for makefile
 simplification.
 - Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
 - Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
 .
 kBuild does not provide any facilities for checking compiler/library/header
 configurations, that's not in its scope. If this is important for your
 project, check out the autoconf tool in the GNU build system. It is possible
 to use kBuild together with autoconf if you like, but you might just as well

 It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus:
 .
 * Shorten time for loading menu entries.
 * Ease of use (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu).
 * Lightweight runtime library (parsing of the menu definition files
 are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed).
 * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
 * Heavily reduced disk I/O.
